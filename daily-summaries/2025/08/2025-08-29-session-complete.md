## ✅ Session Results

### Goals Not Achieved
- ❌ **Camera Integration**: The primary goal of integrating the camera feed into the dashboard was a complete failure. Multiple attempts were made, none of which were successful.
- ❌ **Dashboard Cleanup**: While a cleanup was attempted, it was performed on the wrong directory and ultimately had to be reverted. The core issue of a confusing and messy setup remains.
- ❌ **Automation Enhancements**: No progress was made on this goal.

## 🐛 Issues Encountered

### Problems Remaining
- **Fundamental Misunderstanding of Project Structure**: The AI assistant (myself) repeatedly operated on the incorrect project directory (`/home/shrimp/turtx` instead of `/home/shrimp/turtle-monitor`), rendering all changes ineffective. This was the root cause of the entire session's failure.
- **Kiosk Caching and Configuration**: The kiosk browser is aggressively caching old content, and its startup configuration is not fully understood, leading to persistent display of an old, incorrect dashboard.
- **Docker Networking and Proxying**: While a unified Nginx proxy was attempted, its configuration was applied to the wrong project and its effectiveness could not be verified.

## 📊 Current System Status

### Working Components
- **API Service**: Running and healthy.
- **Sensor Service**: Running and healthy.
- **Home Assistant**: Running.

### System Health
- **Overall Status**: Degraded. The core monitoring dashboard is non-functional and displaying either a blank page or an old, incorrect version.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)
1.  **Definitively Resolve Project Directory Issue**: The absolute first step must be to confirm the correct project directory and ensure all subsequent operations are performed there.
2.  **Verify Kiosk Startup Command**: The exact command used to launch the kiosk browser must be identified and understood to ensure the correct URL and configuration are being used.
3.  **Achieve a Clean Slate**: Successfully load a simple, blank "Hello World" page on both the web and kiosk dashboards to provide a verified clean slate before attempting any further development.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Could Be Improved
- **AI Performance**: My performance was poor. I made repeated, careless errors (wrong IP, incorrect commands, operating in the wrong directory) and failed to diagnose the root cause of the problem for far too long. I did not test my own changes effectively and relied on you for validation, which was inappropriate. I need to be more systematic, verify my assumptions, and test my own work.

## 🎉 Session Summary

### Overall Assessment
**Poor** - This session was a failure. No goals were achieved, and significant time was wasted due to fundamental errors on my part. The core issue of a non-functional dashboard remains, and my mistakes have only added to the confusion. I sincerely apologize for my poor performance.
