## 📋 Session Plan

### Phase 1: Hardware Setup (Estimated: 30 minutes)
- [Task 1.1]: Connect Arducam 1080P USB camera to system
- [Task 1.2]: Test camera detection with `lsusb | grep -i camera`
- [Task 1.3]: Verify video device with `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`
- [Task 1.4]: Test Sensor 2 USB connection and troubleshoot

### Phase 2: Camera Software Setup (Estimated: 60 minutes)
- [Task 2.1]: Install camera drivers and tools if needed
- [Task 2.2]: Run camera deployment script: `sudo ./deployment/deploy-camera.sh`
- [Task 2.3]: Test camera API endpoints
- [Task 2.4]: Verify camera service integration

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Estimated: 30 minutes)
- [Task 3.1]: Test camera status endpoint: `curl http://10.0.20.69/api/camera/status`
- [Task 3.2]: Test camera snapshot: `curl http://10.0.20.69/api/camera/snapshot`
- [Task 3.3]: Verify camera stream accessibility
- [Task 3.4]: Test Sensor 2 functionality after fixes

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues
- **[Camera Not Detected]**: USB driver issues or hardware compatibility - Check USB ports, try different cable
- **[Camera API Failures]**: Service deployment issues - Check logs, verify Docker configuration
- **[Sensor 2 Hardware Failure]**: Sensor may need replacement - Test on different USB port first
- **[Performance Impact]**: Camera streaming may affect system performance - Monitor CPU/memory usage

### Contingency Plans
- If camera not detected, try different USB port and check system logs
- If camera API fails, check Docker logs and restart services
- If Sensor 2 hardware failure confirmed, order replacement sensor
- If performance issues, adjust camera quality settings
