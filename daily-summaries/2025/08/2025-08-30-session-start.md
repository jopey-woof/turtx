## 📋 Session Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **🔧 Fix Project Directory Confusion**: Resolve the fundamental issue where operations were performed on the wrong directory (`/home/shrimp/turtx` vs `/home/shrimp/turtle-monitor`)
2. **🎯 Achieve Clean Slate**: Successfully load a simple, working dashboard on both web and kiosk interfaces
3. **📹 Camera Integration**: Implement proper camera feed integration into the dashboard
4. **🧹 Dashboard Cleanup**: Organize and clean up the dashboard code structure

### Secondary Objectives
- **🔍 Verify Kiosk Configuration**: Understand and verify the kiosk startup configuration
- **🌐 Test API Connectivity**: Ensure all API endpoints are working correctly
- **📊 Validate Sensor Data**: Confirm sensor data is being displayed properly

---

## 📊 Current System Status

### Working Components
- ✅ **Git Repository**: Clean state with only one modified file (`turtle-monitor/frontend/index.html`)
- ✅ **Frontend Code**: Comprehensive multi-page dashboard with status, camera, and data pages
- ✅ **API Structure**: Well-defined API endpoints and configuration
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Organized directory structure following best practices

### Issues from Previous Session
- ❌ **Project Directory Confusion**: Operations were performed on wrong directory
- ❌ **Kiosk Caching**: Aggressive browser caching preventing updates
- ❌ **Camera Integration**: Multiple failed attempts at camera integration
- ❌ **Dashboard Display**: Non-functional dashboard showing blank or old content

## 🔍 Analysis of Current State

### GitHub Repository Status
- **Repository**: `github.com/jopey-woof/turtx`
- **Branch**: `main` (up to date with origin)
- **Modified Files**: Only `turtle-monitor/frontend/index.html` has uncommitted changes
- **Recent Commits**: Clean commit history with proper organization

### Frontend Analysis
The current `index.html` file contains:
- ✅ **Multi-page Dashboard**: Status, Camera, and Data pages
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Optimized for 1024x600 touchscreen
- ✅ **API Integration**: Proper API endpoint configuration
- ✅ **Camera Management**: Multiple camera URL fallbacks
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: 2-second update intervals
- ✅ **Touch Navigation**: Swipe gestures for page navigation
- ✅ **Animations**: Star field, moon phase, and Nyan turtle animations

### Key Technical Features
- **API Base URL**: `http://10.0.20.69/api`
- **Camera URLs**: Multiple fallback endpoints for camera streams
- **Sensor Integration**: Real-time temperature and humidity display
- **Weather Integration**: Mock weather data (ready for real API)
- **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time connection status indicators

## 🎯 Session Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Recovery
1. **Verify Correct Project Directory**: Confirm operations are performed on `/home/shrimp/turtle-monitor`
2. **Test Current Dashboard**: Load and verify the existing dashboard works
3. **Clear Kiosk Cache**: Implement proper cache-busting and verify kiosk displays current content

### Phase 2: Camera Integration
1. **Test Camera Endpoints**: Verify each camera URL in the fallback list
2. **Implement Camera Stream**: Get live camera feed working in the dashboard
3. **Add Camera Controls**: Implement snapshot and camera switching functionality

### Phase 3: Dashboard Enhancement
1. **Clean Up Code**: Organize and optimize the dashboard code
2. **Add Real Weather**: Replace mock weather with real weather API
3. **Enhance Animations**: Improve visual effects and performance

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Must Achieve
- ✅ **Correct Directory Operations**: All commands must target the right project directory
- ✅ **Working Dashboard**: At minimum, a "Hello World" page must load on both web and kiosk
- ✅ **Camera Feed**: At least one camera endpoint must work and display in the dashboard

### Success Metrics
- Dashboard loads without errors on both web browser and kiosk
- Camera feed displays live video in the camera page
- Sensor data updates in real-time
- Navigation between pages works smoothly
- No console errors or failed API calls

## 💡 Lessons from Previous Session

### What to Avoid
- ❌ **Directory Confusion**: Always verify the correct project directory before operations
- ❌ **Insufficient Testing**: Test each change immediately after implementation
- ❌ **Relying on User Validation**: Perform thorough self-testing before reporting results
- ❌ **Complex Changes**: Start with simple, verifiable changes before complex integrations

### What to Improve
- ✅ **Systematic Approach**: Follow a step-by-step verification process
- ✅ **Immediate Testing**: Test each change as soon as it's implemented
- ✅ **Clear Communication**: Provide detailed status updates and error reporting
- ✅ **Fallback Planning**: Always have backup approaches for critical functionality
