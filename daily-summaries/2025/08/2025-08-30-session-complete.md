## üêõ Issues Encountered

### Problems Solved
- **Multiple HTTP Servers**: Identified and stopped conflicting Python HTTP servers on ports 8080, 8090
- **Port Conflicts**: Resolved API binding conflicts by killing competing processes
- **Chrome Kiosk Issues**: Stopped problematic kiosk Chrome process pointing to wrong dashboard
- **Command Timeouts**: Implemented timeout wrappers to prevent hanging SSH commands

### Problems Remaining
- **Camera API Dependencies**: OpenCV library dependencies causing import errors in Docker container
- **API Endpoint Routing**: Camera endpoints not properly accessible through nginx proxy
- **Service Coordination**: Need better orchestration between nginx, API, and frontend services

### Workarounds Implemented
- **Timeout Commands**: Added timeout wrappers to all SSH commands to prevent hanging
- **Process Cleanup**: Manual process killing to resolve port conflicts
- **Git Restore**: Used git restore to reset modified files to clean state

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Successfully identified root causes of service conflicts
- **Timeout Implementation**: Prevented hanging commands with proper timeout usage
- **Clean Restoration**: Effectively restored system to stable working state

### What Could Be Improved
- **Initial Planning**: Should have checked existing services before starting new implementations
- **Dependency Management**: Need better strategy for Docker container dependencies (OpenCV)
- **Service Coordination**: Require proper orchestration instead of ad-hoc process management

### Best Practices Identified
- **Always Use Timeouts**: SSH commands must have timeout wrappers to prevent hanging
- **Check Existing Services**: Always audit running processes before starting new ones
- **Simple Solutions First**: Prefer simple fixes over complex rewrites for living creature monitoring

- **Complexity Concerns**: User preferred simple solutions over complex rewrites
- **Command Hanging Issues**: User identified hanging commands as major productivity blocker

### Future Considerations
- **Camera Implementation**: Need proper Docker setup with OpenCV dependencies
- **API Architecture**: Consider microservices vs monolithic API approach
- **Monitoring Reliability**: Critical that turtle monitoring never fails

### Key Takeaways
1. **System Hygiene**: Regular cleanup of experimental files and processes is essential
2. **Timeout Discipline**: All remote commands must use timeouts to prevent hanging
3. **Living System Priority**: Real creature monitoring takes precedence over experimental features
