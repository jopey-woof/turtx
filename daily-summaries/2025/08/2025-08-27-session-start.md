## ✅ Current System Status

### Working Components
- **API Service**: ✅ Running on port 8001 - FastAPI serving sensor data
- **Sensor Service**: ✅ Active (1h 24m uptime) - Real-time temperature and humidity data
- **Web Dashboard**: ✅ Fully functional - Shows connected status and sensor data
- **Home Assistant**: ✅ Connected - MQTT integration working with sensor discovery
- **Kiosk Mode**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - Displays dashboard with sensor data
- **Nginx Proxy**: ✅ Working - Properly routing API calls to FastAPI
- **Camera System**: ✅ Connected and streaming - Arducam 1080P USB camera

### Recent Issues/Challenges
- **GitHub Sync**: ⚠️ Local and remote branches have diverged (3 commits each)
- **Untracked Files**: ⚠️ Multiple new files need to be committed or cleaned up
- **CSS Display**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Previous session fixed all CSS artifacts

### System Health
- **Uptime**: 1 hour 24 minutes (sensor service)
- **Performance**: API responding quickly with fresh sensor data
- **Data Quality**: Both sensors online with accurate readings (5-second freshness)

---

## 🎯 Session Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **GitHub Synchronization**: Resolve branch divergence and push all changes
2. **Code Cleanup**: Review and organize untracked files
3. **System Validation**: Ensure all components remain stable after previous fixes

### Secondary Objectives
- Review and document any new features or improvements
- Check for any performance optimizations needed
- Update documentation if needed

### Stretch Goals
- Implement any pending feature requests
- Optimize system performance further
- Add monitoring or alerting capabilities

## 🛠️ Preparation Checklist

### Before Starting
- [x] Check system status: `ssh shrimp@10.0.20.69 'systemctl status temperhum-mqtt'`
- [x] Verify API health: `curl http://10.0.20.69/health`
- [x] Check sensor data: `curl http://10.0.20.69/api/latest`
- [x] Read most recent session complete summary
- [x] Review current system status index
- [x] Gather required hardware/software

### Resources Needed
- SSH access to remote system (10.0.20.69)
- Git repository access
- Current session documentation

---

## 📋 Session Plan

### Phase 1: System Status Review (Estimated: 15 minutes)
- [x] Verify all services are running properly
- [x] Check sensor data quality and freshness
- [x] Validate kiosk mode functionality
- [x] Review recent logs for any issues

### Phase 2: GitHub Synchronization (Estimated: 30 minutes)
- [ ] Review git status and branch divergence
- [ ] Decide on merge strategy (rebase vs merge)
- [ ] Resolve any conflicts if present
- [ ] Push changes to remote repository
- [ ] Verify remote repository is up to date

### Phase 3: Code Organization (Estimated: 45 minutes)
- [ ] Review untracked files and directories
- [ ] Determine which files should be committed
- [ ] Clean up any temporary or test files
- [ ] Organize new features and improvements
- [ ] Update .gitignore if needed

### Phase 4: System Validation (Estimated: 30 minutes)
- [ ] Test all system components after changes
- [ ] Verify kiosk mode still works properly
- [ ] Check sensor data accuracy
- [ ] Validate API endpoints
- [ ] Document any issues found

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues
- **Git Conflicts**: Branch divergence may require conflict resolution
- **System Instability**: Changes could affect running services
- **Data Loss**: Incorrect git operations could lose recent work

### Contingency Plans
- If git conflicts occur, use `git stash` to preserve work and resolve carefully
- If system becomes unstable, revert to last known good state
- If data loss risk, create backup before major operations
