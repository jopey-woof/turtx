# 📅 Daily Summaries - Turtle Monitor Project (AI-Optimized)

## Purpose

This directory contains daily summaries of the turtle monitoring system development progress, **optimized for AI consumption and generation**. Each summary provides structured, machine-readable snapshots of:

- **Current system status** and what's working
- **What was accomplished** during the session
- **What's left to do** and next priorities
- **Technical details** and architecture decisions
- **Issues encountered** and solutions implemented

## AI Usage Instructions

### For AI Reading Summaries
- **Search Pattern**: Look for `## 📅 Date:` headers to find specific dates
- **Status Pattern**: Look for `## ✅ Current System Status` sections
- **Issues Pattern**: Look for `## 🐛 Current Issues` sections
- **Next Steps Pattern**: Look for `## 🎯 Next Steps` sections
- **File References**: Look for `### Files Modified` sections for code changes

### For AI Generating Summaries
- **Use Templates**: Always start with the appropriate template
- **Follow Structure**: Maintain exact section headers and formatting
- **Include Metadata**: Always include date, session type, and duration
- **Be Specific**: Use exact technical details, file paths, and commands
- **Link References**: Include links to related documentation and previous summaries

# Then fill in accomplishments and next steps
```

### Update System Status Index
```bash
# AI should update this after each session
# Update daily-summaries/index/system-status-index.md
```

### Search Recent Summaries
```bash
# AI can use these to find recent information
find daily-summaries/2025/08/ -name "*.md" -mtime -7
grep -r "Current System Status" daily-summaries/2025/08/
