## 🎯 **Deployment Instructions for End User**

### **Step 1: Copy Files to Server**
```bash
# From development machine
scp -r . shrimp@10.0.20.69:/home/shrimp/turtle-monitor/
```

### **Step 2: Deploy System**
```bash
# On Ubuntu server
ssh shrimp@10.0.20.69
cd /home/shrimp/turtle-monitor
sudo setup/deploy-temperhum.sh
```

### **Step 3: Restart Home Assistant**
```bash
# Restart to pick up new MQTT entities
docker-compose restart homeassistant
```

### **Step 4: Verify in Home Assistant UI**
- Navigate to Settings → Devices & Services
- Look for "Turtle Enclosure Sensors" device
- Verify 4 entities are created and showing data

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Service Status**
```bash
sudo systemctl status temperhum-mqtt
# Should show: Active (running)
```

### **Home Assistant Entities**
- `sensor.turtle_shell_temperature` - Shell temperature (°C)
- `sensor.turtle_shell_humidity` - Shell humidity (%)
- `sensor.turtle_enclosure_temperature` - Enclosure temperature (°C)
- `sensor.turtle_enclosure_humidity` - Enclosure humidity (%)

### **MQTT Topics**
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t turtle/sensors/+/+
# Should show real-time sensor data
```
