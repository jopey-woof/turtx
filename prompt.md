2. **Start with Phase 1 only** - Get basic kiosk + Home Assistant working before adding any hardware
3. **Prompt the user for actual secret values** needed for configurations (Wi-Fi passwords, email credentials, etc.)
4. **Use the real secrets** provided by the user to create working configuration files
5. **Create both working configs** (with real secrets) AND template versions (with placeholders)
6. **Clearly identify** which files contain real secrets and must be added to `.gitignore`
7. **Remind the user** to never commit files containing actual secrets to GitHub
8. **Insist on validation** - Don't provide Phase 2+ configurations until Phase 1 is confirmed working
9. **Keep configurations minimal** - Start simple, add complexity only after basics work perfectly
10. **Use current versions** - Always specify latest stable versions of containers, APIs, and software components

### Required Secrets for System Configuration:
- **Wi-Fi Credentials**: Network SSID and password for remote machine connectivity

2. **Dual File Creation**: Generate both working files (with real secrets) and template files (with placeholders)
3. **Environment Files**: Use `.env` files for secrets (add to `.gitignore`)
4. **Secure Storage**: Store secrets in `/home/turtle/secrets/` directory on remote machine
5. **File Permissions**: Restrict secret files to `600` permissions (owner read/write only)
6. **Repository Safety**: Clear identification of files that must never be committed to GitHub
7. **Documentation**: Provide clear instructions for administrators on secret management
8. **Backup Strategy**: Secure backup procedures for critical secrets and configurations

### Repository Structure for Secrets:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ homeassistant/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configuration.yaml (template with placeholders)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets.yaml.template (template file, NOT actual secrets)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/
